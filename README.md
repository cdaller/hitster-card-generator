**Generate custom Hitster-style music game cards from any Spotify playlist!**

Turn your favorite playlists into a physical card game. This tool creates professional-looking cards with neon QR codes for scanning and date-based colored solution backs. It automatically handles the layout for double-sided printing.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **2026 API Update:** As of January 2, 2026, Spotify has temporarily disabled the "Create App" button for new developer accounts. 
> **If you cannot create a Spotify App, use Method 1 (The Webapp) or for more control Method 2 (The Scraper) below.** It requires no API keys and works for any playlist.

## 👀 Preview

The script generates a PDF optimized for duplex printing (the backs are mirrored so they align perfectly when cut).

| **Page 1: Front (Scan to Play)** | **Page 2: Back (Solutions)** |
|:---:|:---:|
| <img src="example_pictures/qr_code_side.png" width="400" alt="PDF Front Page QR Codes"> | <img src="example_pictures/solution_side.png" width="400" alt="PDF Back Page Solutions"> |
| *Neon rings with Spotify QR codes* | *Year-based color gradients (Purple=Oldest, Blue=Newest)* |

## ✨ Features
- **Web Interface:** New Streamlit UI for easy link pasting and instant PDF generation.
- **No API Key Required:** Use the new "Links Mode" to bypass Spotify Developer restrictions.

- **Print Ready:** Outputs a standard A4 PDF with 5x5cm cards in a 4x5 grid layout.
- **Duplex Optimized:** Automatically generates alternating pages with mirrored layouts for accurate double-sided printing.
- **Spotify Integration:** Fetches song metadata (Artist, Title, Year) and Spotify Links automatically using the Spotify Web API.

## Usage

### 🌐 Method 1: Web Interface (Easiest)
The easiest way to generate cards is via my free to use live web app:
👉 **[Hitster Card Generator](https://hitster-card-generator.streamlit.app/)**

1. **Copy Links**: In Spotify Desktop, go into your playlist, select your songs with 'Ctrl+A' and press 'Ctrl+C'.
2. **Paste**: Enter the links into the web app text area.
3. **Download**: Click "Create My PDF" and save your high-res printable file.

[!TIP] A Note on Accuracy (Web App): When using the Web Interface, the years are pulled directly from Spotify/iTunes metadata. While highly convenient, these sources occasionally provide "Remaster" or "Re-release" years.

If you need 100% original release dates: Please use Method 2 (Local Script), which allows you to review and edit the songs.json metadata before the final PDF is generated.

### Method 2: No-API Scraper (Patch for current problems with unavailable Spotify API keys)
Use this if you can't get Spotify API keys. It handles playlists of any size (300+ songs).

1. **Collect Links:** Open the Spotify Desktop App, select your songs ('Ctrl+A'), and ('Ctrl+C').
2. **Save Links:** Create a file named `links.txt` in the project root and paste the links inside.
3. **Run:**
```bash
python src/hitster_card_creator.py
```

### Method 3: Official Spotify API

Use this if you already have an existing Spotify App.

Open `src/hitster_card_creator.py` and replace the placeholders:

```python
PLAYLIST_URL = "your_spotify_playlist_url_here"
CLIENT_ID = "your_client_id_here"
CLIENT_SECRET = "your_client_secret_here"
```

Or better create a `.env` file in the project directory and set the credentials there. See `.env.example` as a template.

Then run:
```bash
python src/hitster_card_creator.py
```

## Setup Spotify API Credentials

1. **Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)**

2. **Log in with your Spotify account** (or create one)

3. **Create an app:**
   - Click "Create app"
   - App name: `Hitster Card Generator` (or any name)
   - App description: `Generate game cards from playlists`
   - Redirect URI: `https://localhost` (required but not used)
   - Check "Web API"
   - Click "Save"

4. **Get your credentials:**
   - On your app page, click "Settings"
   - Copy your **Client ID**
   - Click "View client secret" and copy your **Client Secret**

## 🔧 Accuracy Fix (Incorrect Years)

The script uses MusicBrainz and iTunes services to fix wrong years (Spotify often provides "Remaster" or "Greatest Hits" years (e.g., 2011) instead of the original release date).

If the years are still wrong, one can use AI to fix them:

1.  Run the script once. It will save `hitster_cards/songs.json`.
2.  Open `songs.json` or paste it into ChatGPT/Gemini with this prompt:
    > "Correct the years in this JSON to the original single release dates. Return valid JSON."
3.  Save the corrected file back to `hitster_cards/songs.json`.
4.  Run the script again. It will use your corrected local file instead of Spotify data.

## Output

The script generates:
- **Card images:** `hitster_cards/card_001_qr.png`, `card_001_solution.png`, etc.
- **Print-ready PDF:** `hitster_cards.pdf`

### PDF Layout
- **Page 1:** Cards 1-20 (QR fronts, black background)
- **Page 2:** Cards 1-20 (Solution backs, white background, mirrored for duplex)
- **Page 3:** Cards 21-40 (QR fronts)
- **Page 4:** Cards 21-40 (Solution backs)
- And so on...

## Printing Instructions

1. Print the PDF double-sided (flip on long edge)
2. Cut along the gaps (2mm spacing between cards)
3. Each card should be 5cm x 5cm

## Customization

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` (this allows to set spotify credentials and use `git` to manage your changes without commiting the secrets to git!).

The `.env` file can then be used to configure the creation of the cards.

Some parameters can also be overridden by command line parameters:

```bash
src/hitster_card_creator.py --help                                                                       
usage: hitster_card_creator.py [-h] [--fetch] [--ink-save-mode] [--card-draw-border] [--card-label CARD_LABEL] [--file FILE]

Hitster Card Generator

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --fetch               Force re-fetching data and remove existing songs.json
  --ink-saving-mode     if set, print the qr cards in ink saving mode (white background, black qr code)
  --card-draw-border    if set, draw border around the qr cards for easier cutting
  --card-label CARD_LABEL
                        Add a small label to each card (e.g. event name or playlist identifier)
  --file FILE           Set the json file to use as data source (overrides fetch and links.txt)
  ```

### Save Ink

* `INK_SAVING_MODE`: if enabled, the QR code side is also printed white and the solution side cards are not filled, but only marked with a thick frame in the solution color.
* `CARD_DRAW_BORDER`: if enabled, the QR side of the cards gets a black or white border (depending on background color).
* `CARD_LABEL`: Add a small label to each card (e.g. event name or playlist identifier)

```bash
# layout of cards:
# print the qr cards in ink saving mode (white background, black qr code)
INK_SAVING_MODE=true
# draw border around the qr cards for easier cutting
CARD_DRAW_BORDER=true
```

### Change color gradient
Edit the `COLOR_GRADIENT` list in the script:
```python
COLOR_GRADIENT = [
    "#7030A0",  # Purple (oldest)
    "#4169E1",  # Blue (newest)
]
```

### Adjust card layout
Modify these variables:
```python
cards_per_row = 4
cards_per_col = 5
card_size = 5 * cm
gap_size = 0.2 * cm
```

## Troubleshooting

**"Module not found" error:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**"Playlist not found" (404 error):**
- Make sure your playlist is **public** (Spotify API can't access private playlists with client credentials)

**QR codes not scanning:**
- Ensure printer settings: "Actual size" (not "Fit to page")
- Print at high quality/resolution
